## Setting Up the Environment

### Creating a Virtual Environment

To isolate your project dependencies, it's a good practice to use a virtual environment. Here's how you can set it up:

#### Windows/macOS/Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

Once you've created a virtual environment, you need to activate it:

#### Windows

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS/Linux

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

After activating the virtual environment, you can install the project dependencies with:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
